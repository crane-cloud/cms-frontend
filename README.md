# Crane Cloud CMS Frontend

This is a repo for the CMS Frontend for Crane Cloud.

## Setup

Follow these steps to have a local running copy of the CMS Frontend.

To set up the Frontend, clone the repo:

1 - Clone the repo https://github.com/crane-cloud/cms-frontend.git If `master` is not up to date, checkout `develop`.

2 - We prefer `Yarn` over NPM but both are supported.

3 - Install the dependencies using 'yarn' or 'npm install' with ```yarn install``` or ```npm install```

4 - Create a `.env` file and add the CMS backend URL. Specifically, like this: `REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=the_cms_backend_url`

5 - Run 'yarn start' to start the server.
